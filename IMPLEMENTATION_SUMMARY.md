## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed Issues

### Calendar Component
The implementation initially used a Calendar component from shadcn/ui that doesn't exist in the codebase. This has been fixed by using native HTML5 date/time inputs (`type="datetime-local"`), which is consistent with the rest of the application.

**Changed Files:**
- `src/atomic-crm/deals/interactions/DealInteractionCreate.tsx` - Now uses `<Input type="datetime-local" />`
- `src/atomic-crm/timers/TimerCreateDialog.tsx` - Now uses `<Input type="datetime-local" />`

This provides a consistent UX with the rest of the application and doesn't require additional dependencies.

## üöÄ How to Use

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Required

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migrations to create tables:
```bash
# If using local Supabase
npx supabase db reset

# If using remote Supabase
npx supabase db push
```

### 2. Timer Processing (Production)
For automated timer execution, configure pg_cron in Supabase:

1. Enable pg_cron extension in Supabase dashboard
2. Set up cron job to call the Edge Function every 5 minutes:
```sql
select cron.schedule(
  'process-timers',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$select net.http_post(
    url := 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-timers',
    headers := jsonb_build_object('Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY')
  )$$
);
```

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` and `YOUR_ANON_KEY` with actual values.

### 3. Email Notifications
Email notifications use the existing Postmark integration. Ensure:
- Postmark is configured in your Edge Functions
- Timer template is properly set up
- `timer_notification` type is handled in the postmark function

## üé® UI/UX Highlights
- **Italian language** throughout (as per requirement)
- **Responsive design** - works on mobile and desktop
- **Consistent UI** - Uses existing shadcn/ui components
- **Color-coded priorities** - Visual feedback for urgency
- **Empty states** - Helpful messages when no data
- **Loading states** - Graceful handling of async operations
- **Optimistic updates** - Immediate UI feedback

## üîí Security
- All tables have RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Notifications only visible to assigned users
- Timers and interactions respect authentication
- File uploads use existing secure bucket system

## ‚ö° Performance
- Indexed columns for fast queries (`notifications_user_id_read_idx`, `timers_next_trigger_idx`, `dealInteractions_deal_id_idx`)
- Efficient filtering with proper indexes
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Auto-refresh on notifications uses smart polling (30s)

## üìù Notes
- **Timezone**: All times are stored in UTC+0 (as per user requirements)
- **Timer execution**: Requires pg_cron setup in production for automated triggering
- **File storage**: Uses existing Supabase 'attachments' bucket
- **No npm run dev**: User will run the development server manually

## üß™ Testing Checklist
The implementation is complete but pending end-to-end testing. Recommended tests:
- [ ] Create deal interaction with all field types
- [ ] Filter/search interactions timeline
- [ ] View deal dashboard with multiple interactions
- [ ] Create absolute and relative timers
- [ ] Test timer triggers (manually call Edge Function)
- [ ] Verify email notifications sent
- [ ] Test in-app notification flow
- [ ] Test recurring timer logic
- [ ] Pause/resume/complete timers
- [ ] Test notification center UI updates
- [ ] Verify all RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Test with archived deals
- [ ] Test with deleted entities
- [ ] Check timezone handling

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Run database migrations
2. Test the features manually
3. Configure pg_cron for production timer processing
4. Adjust any styling or UX preferences
5. Add any missing edge case handling based on testing
